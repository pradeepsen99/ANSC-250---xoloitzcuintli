								<h2 class="major">History</h2>
								<p>The dog breed Xoloitzcuintli is a hairless dog that originated from Mexico and Central and 
									South America over 3,000 years ago. The Xoloitzcuintli was part of the cultures of the Aztec 
									and Mayan civilizations. According to the National Geographic article, the Xoloitzcuintli 
									name is derived from two Aztec words; Xolotl and Itzcuintli. Xolotl is the Aztec god of 
									lightning and dead, while itzcuintli means dog. The Aztecs believed the Xoloitzcuintli was 
									created by the god Xolotl to guide the souls of the dead through the underworld. They were 
									frequently sacrificed along with their deceased owners to complete the trip through the underworld, 
									guiding them every step of the way. Although the Aztecs had religious beliefs in them they were 
									also being bred for their meat because they believed that it can heal them from their illnesses. 
									Unlike most dogs, this breed was a result of constant natural selection rather than human 
									manipulation; it’s considered a natural breed. Today the Xoloitzcuintli is a rare breed in 
									the United States, but remains common among Mexican households because of the long lasting 
									beliefs of healing powers that the Xoloitzcuintli carries.

								<!-- Where this breed was developed -->
								<article id="breed_developed">
									<h2 class="major">Where breed was developed</h2>
									<p>These dogs were evolved in the jungle. They originate from Colima Mexico and were found in tombs of royalty, 
										specifically those of Colima, Mayan, Toltec, Zapoteca, and Aztec Indians. Unlike most dogs, this breed was a 
										result of constant natural selection rather than human manipulation; it’s considered a natural breed.

								<!-- Why this breed was developed -->
								<article id="breed_location">
									<h2 class="major">Where breed was developed</h2>
									<p>The Xoloitzcuintli was sacred in ancient Mexico where the dogs were sacrificed and placed in the graves of their 
										owners. In traditional Mexico believes, Xolos were thought to safely guide their owner’s souls to the land of 
										the dead. Besides, the Mayas believed that Xolos had healing power for various health conditions.  This belief 
										still remains in the modern Mexico culture, as featured in the 2017 Disney animated film Coco with a Xoloitzcuintlu 
										named Dante.

								<!-- Function of breed -->
								<article id="breed_function">
									<h2 class="major">Function of breed over time</h2>
									<p>From sacred dogs to watchdogs, the role that Xolos play in the society had changed over time.  Nowadays, the Xolos 
										are no longer sacred dogs that people sacrificed but have become good watchdogs and family dogs. Xolos will speak up 
										and alert the owners if anyone comes to the house. They might be reserved with strangers but do not expect them to 
										scare off intruders as they are not usually aggressive.
									</p>

								<!-- AKC Group -->
								<article id="akc_group">
									<h2 class="major">AKC Group</h2>
									<p>Today, the xoloitzcuintli is included in the non-sporting group. This group is described by the AKC as being diverse in 
										overall appearance, size, coats, etc. The AKC considers these dogs hard to generalize as they can greatly vary in 
										appearance as well as personality. While they suggest many of these dogs can be good watch dogs as well as house dogs, 
										these roles can somewhat parallel to their original function. Originally meant for protecting and guiding the souls of 
										their owner to safety through the afterlife, the only quality the AKC didn’t consider was their athletic and hunting abilities. 
									</p>
								</article>

								<!-- Temperment -->
								<article id="temperment">
									<h2 class="major">Temperment</h2>
									<p>Typical Xolo personalities include being attentive with those to whom they’re familiar, but they can be protective and territorial 
										when introduced to new people or animals. Puppies can also be destructive. However, Xolos have a calm temperament when given 
										proper socialization and training. Although the Xoloitzcuintli is commonly known as the hairless dog, there are actually two 
										varieties to the breed - hairless and coated, according to the American Kennel Club. Other than the two skin varieties, the breed 
										also comes in three different size - toy, miniature and standard. The large variety was used for protection whereas the medium and 
										small versions were used as companions or to eat. The breed has not significantly changed over time.

								<!-- Pop Culture -->
								<article id="pop_culture">
									<h2 class="major">Pop Culture</h2>
									<p>TThe Xolos have been represented in pop culture a few times. Today, when people think of Xolos, majority of them will think of Dante, 
										a character off of Pixar’s 2017 movie Coco. In this movie, Dante plays the role of a spirit guide for Miguelito through the underworld, 
										which is how they were viewed by the Aztecs. This film did a good job of portraying this breed, which is due to the fact that artists 
										working on this film interacted with dogs of this breed in order to study and observe them. They learned that Xoloitzcuintlis were very 
										energetic and loyal so they made Dante that way, as well as giving him the physical aspects of an average Xolo.

								<!-- Companion Pet -->
								<article id="companion_pet">
									<h2 class="major">Lifestyle as companion Pet</h2>
									<p>Xolo skin is actually a hide – thick, protective and resistant to injury.  They exude an oil that protects them from the sun and from 
										insects. However, it is recommended to apply sunscreen to their skin for added protection against the sun. They also require frequent 
										bathing, whereas coated Xolos require occasional brushing. Despite these differences, both the coated and hairless varieties have no 
										major health concerns besides acne and occasional patellar luxation. In terms of physical activity, this breed requires only moderate 
										exercise, a daily walk or jog is recommended. When it comes to behavior, Xolos can be attentive with people they’re familiar with; 
										however,  it’s important to be cautious of their interactions with strangers and other animals as they tend to also be protective and 
										territorial. Xolo puppies tend to be destructive; however, this breed is sensitive and smart, meaning gentle positive, training is the 
										best method for these puppies. Proper training of these dogs requires consistency and structure.
